# alcohol_analysis

##Purpose of this analysis.


The purpose of this analysis is to run some exploratory analysis on a dataset from kaggle that contains a variety of features related for students in a maths and portugese course. The features include but are not limited to age,studytime, weekly alcohol consumption, daily alcohol comsumption, and grades in each period.

## The Objective

First goal in my analysis is to run exploratory analysis on both the math and portugese data sets to find out the null values, shape,  and correlation between features.


Second goal is to apply Random Forest Classifier technique on the data set to be able to predict the final grade score in the class for math and portuguese students.
